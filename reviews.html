            <p class="review">I am thrilled with the team! I had a small class to run at a local congregation this weekend and my printer broke down with 2 days to go. Not only were they able to get me the educational handouts printed faster than expected by a whole day, but also I got nicer paper and 3-hole punching done for slightly cheaper than standard color copies at the big-box shops! Amy was a treasure to work with when I called in to ask about the job and timeline, making sure I could get exactly what I wanted, and also making suggestions for better quality without being pushy about unnecessary upsells. Emailing the file and pickup were quick and painless. I can't thank them enough!</p>

            <p class="review">We had a last minute project that was in a bit of a time crunch and CopyCat employees were very punctual and helpful in this situation. They were honest with their abilities and time frame, and they delivered! Working with these folks was very straight forward, highly recommend their services!</p>

            <p class="review">If you have printing, design, creative, etc. needs for personal or business use, you should without hesitation consider working with Jason Ryan and the team at Copy Cat Printing.</p>
            <p class="review">It seems to become increasingly difficult to discover a vendor that you can contact, give them the basic idea of what you are looking for, and have them deliver on all fronts, AND still be affordable. For the business owner and busy client this type of service is what allows us to actually focus on what we need to and not have to waste time chasing service.</p>
            <p class="review">I cannot speak highly enough about this local company. Thank you Copy Cat Printing for being a team player, always looking out for, exceeding expectations and delivering on your client needs!</p>

            <p class="review">We have been using Copy Cat Printing for years! The front office uses them for labels, envelopes, note pads and so forth. My department uses them to print our very large and involved Overhead Crane OEM Manuals, up to 1,600 pages per document with dividers and tabs. Some of the pages must be folded a specific way, some pages are a specific color or have to be printed in color etc. We have strict guidelines to follow regarding our OEM Manuals and I can trust Copy Cat is going to provide exactly what we need.</p>
