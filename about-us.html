        <p>If you were living in the Richmond area in the 70s, 80s, or 90s you probably remember the local Copy Cat print shops. West Ender, Mike McCay, remembers it well. Right after graduating from Douglas Freeman High School in 1974, Mike began working at the original Copy Cat office, which was located off of Dickens Road. During his first 8 years with the company, McCays brother, Scott, and his brother-in-law, Metin Tanir, and long-time friend Lewis Redford also joined the Cat. In the early days, Mike says, there was a real family feel at Copy Cat. But, as the company changed hands several times, he decided to move on. The original Copy Cat closed a few years after his departure in 1999.</p>
        <p>After 18 years away from the printing business, Mike decided he wanted to work for himself and return to the work he knew so well. Additionally he aspired to create a business that he and his family could, again, be involved with. So, he and his wife, Deniz, along with her brother, Metin, joined forces to start the business. Since the original Cat was gone, Mike checked with the State Corporation Commission, and discovered the name was available. Cats have nine lives, he says, and this cat was coming back.</p>
        <p>In October of 2003, Mike and his family revitalized the Copy Cat Printing Company and found its new home on Route 360 in Mechanicsville, Virginia. In August of 2005, Scott and his family returned to the area, from Maryland, and joined the family operation once again.</p>
        <p>The new Copy Cat, while providing photocopying services, graphic design and web design, offers significantly more commercial services. No job is too big or small, Deniz says. In addition to a wide array of printing services, you also get great customer service from the entire staff. We always want you to feel welcome when you walk in the door. But, what makes us really different, Mike says, We are involved in the community. The McCays/Tanirs show that involvement by contributing to many local charitable organizations and schools, both monetarily and with their time.</p>
        <p>Their long-time dream of expanding was finally realized in 2005 by opening a second location in the West End.</p>
        <p>Copy Cat is still on the road, offering free pickup and delivery anywhere in the Metro area.</p>
